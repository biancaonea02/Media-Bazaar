# Media Bazaar
This project consists of a desktop application and a website, which will help Media Bazaar company, a hardware store, manage better their employees and products.
The aim of these applications is managing employees effectively and keeping track of their shifts and working hours, as well as managing and keeping track of the products, meaning that the employees need to be able to request new product shipments from the warehouse when there are low supplies on certain products in the store. Furthermore, a search feature for the products is present so browsing by category in the application is going to be more effective.
